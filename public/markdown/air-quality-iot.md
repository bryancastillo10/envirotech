      IoT for Air Quality Monitoring represents the convergence of advanced sensor technology and digital communication networks to provide comprehensive, real-time air quality data. These systems utilize a network of low-cost, energy-efficient sensors that detect and measure various air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The data collected by these sensors is transmitted wirelessly to cloud-based platforms, where it is analyzed and visualized in real time. This real-time monitoring enables cities, industries, and individuals to make informed decisions about air quality management, from issuing public health warnings to optimizing air purification systems. The IoT approach allows for the deployment of numerous sensors across a wide geographical area, providing granular data that traditional monitoring systems cannot match. Additionally, IoT devices can be integrated with smart city infrastructures, enabling automated responses, such as adjusting traffic flow or activating air purification systems when pollutant levels exceed safe thresholds. The technology not only improves public health outcomes by providing early warnings of hazardous air quality but also supports compliance with environmental regulations and promotes proactive measures to reduce air pollution.
